/* This file contains optimization for global variable's address loading
   from GOT.

   When generating PIC code, we need to load global variable's address from
   GOT. Many targets do this as following:

        (set pic_reg ...)       # load the base address of GOT into pic_reg.
            ...
        (set off_set ...)       # load the offset from the base of GOT to
                                # a global variable's GOT entry.
        (set address            # load the address from GOT.
             (mem (plus pic_reg off_set)))
            ...

   If the target has an alternative method (usually uses a different
   relocation) to load the global address and in some cases it has less
   cost and avoid the pic_reg, we can use this pass to improve it.

   In order to employ this optimization the target must satisfy the
   following constraints:

   1. There should be at least 2 methods to load a global variable's
      address from GOT.

   2. By default all global variables accesses use the method described
      above.

   3. There is a target dependent situation that the alternative method is
      better when considering the number of global variable accesses and
      the number of accessed variables.

   4. The alternative method doesn't use the base of GOT (pic_reg).

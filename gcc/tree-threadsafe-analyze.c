/* This file contains an analysis pass that uses the thread safety attributes
   to identify and warn about potential issues that could result in data
   races and deadlocks. The thread safety attributes currently support only
   lock-based synchronization. They help developers document the locks that
   need to be used to safely read and write shared variables and also the
   order in which they intend to acquire locks. Here is the list of the
   attributes that this analysis pass uses:

     __attribute__ ((lockable))
     __attribute__ ((scoped_lockable))
     __attribute__ ((guarded_by(x)))
     __attribute__ ((guarded))
     __attribute__ ((point_to_guarded_by(x)))
     __attribute__ ((point_to_guarded))
     __attribute__ ((acquired_after(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((acquired_before(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((exclusive_lock(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((shared_lock(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((exclusive_trylock(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((shared_trylock(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((unlock(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((exclusive_locks_required(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((shared_locks_required(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((locks_excluded(__VA_ARGS__)))
     __attribute__ ((lock_returned(x)))
     __attribute__ ((no_thread_safety_analysis))
     __attribute__ ((ignore_reads_begin))
     __attribute__ ((ignore_reads_end))
     __attribute__ ((ignore_writes_begin))
     __attribute__ ((ignore_writes_end))
     __attribute__ ((unprotected_read))

   If multi-threaded code is annotated with these attributes, this analysis
   pass can detect the following potential thread safety issues:

     * Accesses to shared variables and function calls are not guarded by
       proper (read or write) locks
     * Locks are not acquired in the specified order
     * A cycle in the lock acquisition order
     * Try to acquire a lock that is already held by the same thread
       - Useful when locks are non-reentrant 
     * Locks are not acquired and released in the same routine (or in the
       control-equivalent blocks)
       - Having critical sections starting and ending in the same routine
         is a better practice
   
   The analysis pass uses a single-pass (or single iteration) data-flow
   analysis to maintain live lock sets at each program point, using the
   attributes to decide when to add locks to the live sets and when to
   remove them from the sets. With the live lock sets and the attributes
   attached to shared variables and functions, we are able to check whether
   the variables and functions are well protected. Note that the reason why
   we don't need iterative data flow analysis is because critical sections
   across back edges are considered a bad practice.  */

/* Build a fully-qualified name of a lock that is a class member with the

   usually used when handling lock_returned, lock, and unlock attributes.
   For example, given the following code

   class Bar {
     public:
       bool MyLock() __attributes__ ((exclusive_lock(mu1_)));
       void MyUnlock() __attributes__ ((unlock(mu1_)));

     b2->a_ = 3;      // S3
     b1->MyUnlock();  // S4

   When analyzing statement S1, instead of adding "mu1_" to the live lock
   set, we need to build the fully-qualified name, b1->mu1, first and add
   the fully-qualified name to the live lock set. The same goes for the unlock
   statement in S4. Without using the fully-qualified lock names, we won't
   be able to tell the lock requirement difference between S2 and S3.  */

/* Given a lock expression, this function returns a canonicalized

   function does the following to canonicalize the expression:

   - Fold temp variables. e.g.

           D.1 = &q->mu;  ==>   foo (&q->mu);
           foo (D.1);

   - Fold SSA names. e.g.

   - Replace function calls that return a lock with the actual lock returned
     (if it is annotated with "lock_returned" attribute).

   - Subexpressions of the lock are canonicalized recursively.

   When matching two expressions, we currently only do it symbolically.
   That is, if two different pointers, say p and q, point to the same
   location, they will not map to the same canonical expr.

   This function can also be called to get a canonical form of an expression
   which may not be a lock. For example, when trying to canonicalize the base

/* This function handles function calls that acquire or try to acquire
   locks (i.e. the functions annotated with exclusive_lock, shared_lock,
   exclusive_trylock, or shared_trylock attribute). Besides adding to the
   live lock sets the lock(s) it acquires (except for trylock calls), this
   function also does the following:

   - Checks the lock acquisition order between the lock it acquires and
     existing live locks.

   - Checks if any existing live lock is being acquired again
     (i.e. re-entered).

   - If the function call is a constructor of a scoped lock, adds an entry
     with the acquired lock to scopedlock_to_lock_map.

   - If the function call is a trylock, creates a trylock_info structure and
     inserts it to trylock_info_map.

   - Records the source location of this function call in lock_locus_map
     (as this is where the lock is acquired).

   This function handles one lock at a time, so if a locking primitive
   acquires multiple locks, this function is called multiple times (see
   process_function_attrs() below).

   Besides the call itself (CALL), we also pass in the function decl (FDECL).
   While the function decl of a call can be easily extracted by calling
   gimple_call_fndecl in most cases, it becomes a bit tricky when the function
   is virtual as gimple_call_fndecl will simply return NULL. We will need to
   get the function decl through the reference object in this case.
   Since we have already done all the things necessary to get the function
   decl earlier (see handle_call_gs()), instead of doing the whole dance again
   here, we might as well pass in the function decl that we extracted earlier.

   The lock to be acquired is either the base object (i.e. BASE_OBJ)
   when the primitive is a member function of a lockable class (e.g. "mu" in
   mu->Lock()), or specified by an attribute parameter and passed in as ARG.
   If ARG is an integer constant, it specifies the position of the primitive's
